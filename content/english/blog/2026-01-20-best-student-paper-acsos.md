I am thrilled to announce that our paper, **"A Field-based Approach for Runtime Replanning in Swarm Robotics Missions"**, won the **Best Student Paper Award** at **ACSOS 2025**!

In this work, we tackle the challenge of ensuring mission success for multi-robot systems in unpredictable environments. We propose a field-based runtime task replanning approach grounded in **aggregate programming**. This allows robots to make decentralized decisions and collectively adapt plans in real-time, even in areas with unreliable network infrastructure.

Our experiments show that this approach performs close to an oracle centralized planner and significantly outperforms baselines under sparse communication conditions.
