## Description

**Project Emerge** is an open-source swarm robotics platform designed to make swarm robotics research more accessible and affordable. The project aims to provide a modular, low-cost, and easy-to-assemble robot kit, along with open-source software for control and coordination.

## Goals

- Develop a modular and affordable swarm robot kit.
- Provide open-source hardware and software resources.
- Enable researchers, educators, and hobbyists to experiment with swarm robotics.
- Foster a community around open-source swarm robotics.
