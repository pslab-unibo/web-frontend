    title : Aggregate Computing
    content : |
      Aggregate computing is a paradigm for distributed systems 
      enabling developers to define high-level collective behaviors emerging from local interactions.
      Our group is among the founders of the paradigm focusing on languages and tools
      that abstract the complexity of low-level communication and coordination in large scale systems.

    title : Distributed Intelligence
    content: |
      Distributed Intelligence studies how intelligent behavior emerges from networks of learning and decision-making entities.
      Our group investigates self-organising and swarm-based AI, federated learning for collaborative training,
      and distributed reinforcement learning for coordinated adaptation.

    title : Digital Twins
    content: |
      Committed to bridging the physical and digital worlds, we are developing Digital Twins that mirror real-world entities and processes.
      Our focus is in researching architectures and platforms to support the development of Digital Twins
      and their application to digitalize complex and dynamic ecosystems involving multiple heterogeneous assets and technologies.

    title : Multi-Agent Systems
    content: |
      Multi-Agent Systems approach the development of distributed systems involving multiple autonomous entities that reason, learn, and interact with each other.
      Our group research methodologies and tools to support the design, implementation, and deployment of Multi-Agent Systems, to develop autonomous and adaptive systems.

    title : NeuroSymbolic AI
    content: |
      NeuroSymbolic AI is an emerging field that combines neural networks and symbolic reasoning to develop AI systems that can learn from data and reason over it.
      Our group is contributing by focusing the development of explainable and interpretable AI systems.

    title : Complex Systems
    content: |
      Complex Systems are systems composed of many interacting entities that exhibit emergent properties.
      Our group is researching methodologies and tools to model, simulate, and analyze complex systems, to understand their behavior and predict their evolution.
